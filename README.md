# fundraiser-project
Fundraiser Project that allows people to fund/donate USD, converting it into ETH using @Chainlink 's Price Feed. This allows the owner, and only the owner (using my function modifier), of said contract to withdraw funds. 
Done with the help of @CyfrinUpdraft 's 'Soldiity Smart Contract Developement' course.
